When news began to spread of Henry I's death, Matilda and Geoffrey were in Anjou, supporting the rebels in their campaign against the royal army, which included a number of Matilda's supporters such as Robert of Gloucester.[52] Many of these barons had taken an oath to stay in Normandy until the late king was properly buried, which prevented them from returning to England.[88] Nonetheless, the couple took the opportunity to march into southern Normandy and seize a number of key castles around Argentan that had formed Matilda's disputed dowry.[89] They then stopped, unable to advance further, pillaging the countryside and facing increased resistance from the Norman nobility and a rebellion in Anjou itself.[90] Matilda was by now also pregnant with her third son, William; opinions vary among historians as to how much this affected her military plans.[91][nb 11]

Meanwhile, news of Henry's death had reached Stephen of Blois, conveniently placed in Boulogne, and he left for England, accompanied by his military household. Robert of Gloucester had garrisoned the ports of Dover and Canterbury and some accounts suggest that they refused Stephen access when he first arrived.[92] Nonetheless Stephen reached the edge of London by 8 December and over the next week he began to seize power in England.[93] The crowds in London proclaimed Stephen the new monarch, believing that he would grant the city new rights and privileges in return, and his brother Henry of Blois, the bishop of Winchester, delivered the support of the Church to Stephen.[94] Stephen had sworn to support Matilda in 1127, but Henry convincingly argued that the late king had been wrong to insist that his court take the oath, and suggested that the King had changed his mind on his deathbed.[95][nb 12] Stephen's coronation was held at Westminster Abbey on 22 December.

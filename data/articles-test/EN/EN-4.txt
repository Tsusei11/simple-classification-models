In late 1108 or early 1109, Henry V of Germany sent envoys to Normandy proposing that Matilda marry him, and wrote separately to her mother on the same matter.[15] The match was attractive to the English king: his daughter would be marrying into one of the most prestigious dynasties in Europe, reaffirming his own, slightly questionable, status as the youngest son of a new royal house, and gaining him an ally in dealing with France.[16] In return, Henry V would receive a dowry of 10,000 marks, which he needed to fund an expedition to Rome for his coronation as Holy Roman emperor.[17] The final details of the deal were negotiated at Westminster in June 1109 and, as a result of her changing status, Matilda attended a royal council for the first time that October.[17] She left England in February 1110 to make her way to Germany.[18]

The couple met at Li√®ge before travelling to Utrecht where, on 10 April, they became officially betrothed.[19] On 25 July Matilda was crowned German queen in a ceremony at Mainz.[20] There was a considerable age gap between the couple, as Matilda was only eight years old while Henry was 24.[21] After the betrothal she was placed into the custody of Archbishop Bruno of Trier, who was tasked with educating her in German culture, manners and government.[22][23][nb 5] In January 1114 Matilda was ready to be married to Henry, and their wedding was held at the city of Worms amid extravagant celebrations.[24] Matilda now entered public life in Germany, complete with her own household.[

The marriage proved difficult, as the couple did not particularly like each other.[75] There was a further dispute over Matilda's dowry; she was granted various castles in Normandy by Henry, but it was not specified when the couple would actually take possession of them.[76] It is also unknown whether Henry intended Geoffrey to have any future claim on England or Normandy, and he was probably keeping Geoffrey's status deliberately uncertain.[76] Soon after the marriage, Matilda left Geoffrey and returned to Normandy.[75] Henry appears to have blamed Geoffrey for the separation, but the couple were finally reconciled in 1131.[77] Henry summoned Matilda from Normandy, and she arrived in England that August.[78] It was decided that Matilda would return to Geoffrey at a meeting of the King's great council in September.[78] The council also gave another collective oath of allegiance to recognise her as Henry's heir.[78][nb 9]

Matilda gave birth to her first son in March 1133 at Le Mans, the future Henry II.[80] Henry I was delighted by the news and came to see her at Rouen.[81] At Pentecost 1134, her second son, Geoffrey, was born in Rouen, but the childbirth was extremely difficult and Matilda appeared close to death.[82] She made arrangements for her will and argued with her father about where she should be buried. Matilda preferred Bec Abbey, but Henry wanted her to be interred at Rouen Cathedral.[82] Matilda recovered, and Henry was overjoyed by the birth of his second grandson, possibly insisting on another round of oaths from his nobility.

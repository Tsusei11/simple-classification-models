An economic conflict between China and the United States has been ongoing since January 2018, when U.S. president Donald Trump began setting tariffs and other trade barriers on China with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what the U.S. says are longstanding unfair trade practices and intellectual property theft.[1] The first Trump administration stated that these practices may contribute to the U.S.â€“China trade deficit, and that the Chinese government requires transfer of American technology to China.[2] In response to US trade measures, CCP general secretary Xi Jinping's administration accused the Trump administration of engaging in nationalist protectionism and took retaliatory action.[3][4] After the trade war escalated through 2019, in January 2020 the two sides reached a tense phase-one agreement.[5][6][7] By the end of Trump's first presidency, the trade war was widely characterized as a failure for the United States.[8][9]

The Biden administration kept the tariffs in place and added additional levies on Chinese goods such as electric vehicles and solar panels.[10][11][12] In 2024, the Trump presidential campaign proposed a 60 percent tariff on Chinese goods.[13] On February 1, 2025, the Trump administration increased tariffs on China by 10 percent, while on March 4, the administration raised them by another 10 percent. On March 10, China imposed a 15% tariffs on American goods, including agricultural goods. On April 2, 2025, the Trump administration brought the total import tariff on China to 54%, with the Chinese government vowing retaliation in response.

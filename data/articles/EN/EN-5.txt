The Constitution of South Korea and the amended Presidential Election Act of 1987 provide for election of the president by direct, secret ballot, ending sixteen years of indirect presidential elections under the preceding two authoritarian governments. The president is directly elected to a five-year term, with no possibility of re-election.[2] If a presidential vacancy should occur, a successor must be elected within sixty days, during which time presidential duties are to be performed by the prime minister or other senior cabinet members in the order of priority as determined by law. The president is exempt from criminal liability (except for insurrection or treason).

The impeachment of Yoon Suk Yeol on 14 December 2024 suspended then-incumbent president Yoon Suk Yeol, making Prime Minister Han Duck-soo acting president. Han himself was briefly suspended after his own impeachment on 27 December 2024, leading Deputy Prime Minister Choi Sang-mok to assume the role of acting president; however, Han was reinstated by the Constitutional Court of Korea on 24 March 2025.[3][4] Yoon was subsequently removed from office on 4 April 2025, when the Constitutional Court upheld his impeachment; the presidency is thus vacant until the 2025 South Korean presidential election, and in the meantime Han will continue as acting president.

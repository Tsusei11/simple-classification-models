Le Pen has led a movement of "de-demonisation of the National Front" to soften its image,[9] including limited expulsion of members accused of racism, antisemitism or PÃ©tainism. She expelled her father from the party in August 2015, after he made fresh controversial statements.[10][11] While liberalising some political positions of the party by revoking its opposition to same-sex partnerships, its opposition to unconditional abortions, and its support for the death penalty, Le Pen still advocates many of the same historical policies of her party, with particular focus on strong anti-immigration, nationalist and protectionist measures.[12][13][14] She is supportive of economic nationalism, favouring an interventionist role of government, and is opposed to globalisation and multiculturalism. Le Pen supports limiting immigration and banning ritual slaughter.[15] She has made supportive comments of Vladimir Putin and Russia in the past, advocating closer cooperation before the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine; she strongly condemned the war in Ukraine, but stated Russia could become "an ally of France again" if it ends.[16][17] She has supported Israel during the Gaza war.[18][19]

Time named Le Pen one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2011 and 2015.[20][21] In 2016, Politico named her the second-most influential MEP in the European Parliament, after President of the European Parliament Martin Schulz.[22] In January 2024, after months of rising polling numbers, and for the first time ever, Le Pen became the most popular politician in France according to a Verian-Epoka for Le Figaro Magazine.[

Tariffs during the second presidency of Donald Trump have reflected an escalation in protectionist trade policies in the United States, with President Trump announcing a series of high tariffs on imports from all other nations. While his first administration imposed tariffs on approximately $380 billion worth of imports, the total under his second administration is projected to exceed $2.5 trillion by April 2025, increasing the average tariff rate on imports from 2.5% to 16.5%.[1]

Trump escalated an ongoing trade war with China, raising baseline tariffs on imports from the country to an effective 54% after April 9.[2] He initiated a second trade war with Canada and Mexico by imposing a 25% tariff on most Canadian and Mexican goods, but later exempted all USMCA-compliant goods indefinitely.[3] Trump framed these actions as a way to hold the countries accountable for contraband drug trafficking and illegal immigration, while also supporting domestic manufacturing.[4][5] He later imposed a 25% tariff on imported steel, aluminum, and automotive products from all countries, with imported auto part expected to follow.
